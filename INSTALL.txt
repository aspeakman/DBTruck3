Basic installation (for standalone testing) - steps are as follows:

### Check python 3 and set up pip ###
    python -V (check the version is >= 3.8)
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip

### First time development install ###
    Open a command shell
    If the DBTruck3 folder does not exist
        Run 'git clone https://github.com/aspeakman/DBTruck3.git DBTruck3'
        Change directory to 'DBTruck3'
    If the DBTruck3 exists
        Change directory to 'DBTruck3'
        Run 'git clone https://github.com/aspeakman/DBTruck3.git .'
    Run 'pip -m venv venv'
    Enter the 'venv' virtual environment
        Run 'source venv/bin/activate' or 'venv\scripts\activate.bat' depending on your local host
        Or adapt the 'runsh' or 'runcmd.bat' scripts in the 'scripts' sub-directory
    Once you see the (venv) prompt
    Run 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel'
    Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' (once only step to install required libraries)
    If requirements.txt changes subsequently:
    Run 'pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt' (with optonal --force-reinstall if required)
    If you want to use PostgreSQL 'python -m pip install psycopg2'
    If you want to use MySQL 'python -m pip install mysql-connector-python'
    Try 'python tests.py'
    
### To update software version subsequently ###
    Open a command shell
    Change directory to 'DBTruck3'
    Run 'git pull'
    
### To use as a package in another project
    Install as above then link to the local repository within the other project
        python -m pip install -e <path to DBTruck3 folder used above>
    Alternatively (you can replace 'main' with any other branch)
        python -m pip install -U "dbtruck @ https://github.com/aspeakman/DBTruck3/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"
    Or (optionally you can append @branch or @version)
        python -m pip install -U "dbtruck @ git+https://github.com/aspeakman/DBTruck3.git"
